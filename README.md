# OCR-and-Document-Search-Web-Application

This is a Web-based prototype that demonstrates the ability to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an uploaded image (in picture format) containing text in both Hindi and English. The web application should also implement a basic keyword search functionality based on the extracted text.
This OCR Web Application allows you to upload images containing text in Hindi and English, extract text, search for keywords, and download results in various formats. This project uses Pytesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for Python.
